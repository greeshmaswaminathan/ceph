 * Calculation of recovery priorities has been updated.
   This could lead to unintuitive recovery prioritization
   during cluster upgrade. In case of such recovery, OSDs
   in old version would operate on different priority ranges
   than new ones. Once upgraded, cluster will operate on
   consistent values.
